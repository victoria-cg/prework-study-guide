# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## The study guide was created to provide a webpage for students to store their bootcamp notes. It is organized by bootcamp topic, and it provides a way for students to organize the large amount of information they are learning. I learned basic skills for use of Git and Github, HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the website.

## Usage

Students can use the website to store their notes about topics in each section including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They can also open the DevTools console to see the running JavaScript, which will list the prework bootcamp topics and choose one to study.
